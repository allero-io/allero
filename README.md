Prevent CI/CD misconfiguration
</h1>

## What is Allero?
Allero is a policy tool that prevents misconfigurations in CI/CD pipelines. 
This helps prevent failures and security risks from reaching production. It also allows R&D teams be less dependent on DevOps engineers when building and maintaining CI/CD pipelines.
Allero comes with built-in rules, and developed to be as friendly as possible for you to create your own rules!  
**Here are a few use-cases that can be mitigated with Allero:**
1. Prevent Log4shell vulnerability by making sure SCA runs in every pipeline.
2. Prevent the use of deprecated language versions. (e.g. Node version <= 12)  
3. Ensure all IaC manifests are scanned for misconfigurations. (e.g. Run checkov on any terraform file)


## Quick Start!
Allero supports GitHub Actions and GitLab Pipelines.
### 1. Install the latest release in your terminal
_Linux & MacOS:_ `curl https://get.allero.io | /bin/bash`  
_Brew:_ `brew install allero-io/allero/allero`  
_Windows:_ `iwr -useb https://get.allero.io/windows_install.ps1 | iex`


### 2. Validate your pipelines
Local directory - a direct validate:
* Validate your pipelines located under a path: `allero validate {path}`
Remote directory - Fetch your data and then validate:
* Fetch your organizations and/or repositories: `allero fetch github dapr/dapr`
* Validate your pipelines across all your fetched data: `allero validate`

### Fetching private repositories from Github
Fetching data from a private GitHub organization requires a personal access token (PAT).
1. Create a GitHub PAT with access to the repos you want to scan. More information about how to create a Github PAT can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-token) 
Generate the token with the following **read** permissions:
    - [x]  repo:
        - [x]  repo:status
        - [x]  repo_deployment
        - [x]  public_repo
        - [x]  repo:invite
        - [x]  security_events

2. Once the token is generated, run `export ALLERO_GITHUB_TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN}`.  
- When running Allero from GitHub Actions, the PAT should be stored as an [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository).
3. Fetch your private repositories: `allero fetch github {your_repo}`

### Fetching private repositories from Gitlab
Fetching data from a private GitLab group requires an access token.
1. Create a GitLab Access Token with access to the repos you want to scan. More information about how to create a GitLab Token can be found [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) 
Generate the token with the following permissions:
    - [x]  read_api
2. Once the token is generated, run `export ALLERO_GITLAB_TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN}`.
3. Fetch your private repositories: `allero fetch gitlab {your_repo}`


## Next Steps
### ‚õîÔ∏è Fail a PR on violation 
Allero can fail a PR if the repo's pipelines don't meet the policy.
Use this [GitHub Action](https://github.com/allero-io/allero/tree/main/examples/integrations/allero-validate-on-pr.yml) to trigger allero validation on a PR event.
### üõ° Continuously assess all your piplines on a daily basis 
To achieve a continuous assessment, allero needs to periodically scan the entire organization.  
_Implementing with GitHub Actions_: We created a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/allero-io/allero/tree/main/examples/integrations/allero-continuous-validation.yml) that runs Allero everyday at 8am on your entire organization.
1. [Fork](https://github.com/allero-io/allero/fork) Allero repo
2. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token and store it in your forked repo as an encrypted secret named `ALLERO_GITHUB_TOKEN`.
3. GitHub disables scheduled Actions on a forked repo by default. To enable the Allero Action, browse to your forked allero repo, navigate to GitHub Actions and enable the workflow. 

_Using any other scheduler:_ as a CLI tool, Allero can be easily run in - CI/CD, docker scheduler, crontab, kubernetes - anywhere!

## üö® Rules
Some rules apply to everyone, while others are very stack-specific. That is why some rules are enabled by default and others are disabled. Learn how to enable and disable rules [here](https://github.com/allero-io/allero#enabling-and-disabling-rules).

### Supported Rules

| _Rule Name_               | _Description_                                            | _Default State_               | _Reason_                                                                                                               |

### Enabling and disabling rules
A policy is a set of rules, and it is represented by a token.  
To generate a token, go to this [page](https://www.allero.io/selective-rules), choose the rules you want and generate the token. The token will be sent to your email.   
To run the policy, you need to set the token by running `allero config set token {your_token}` and re-run `allero validate`. 

#### Temporarily ignore a token
Tokens can be temporarily ignored during a single validation by running `allero validate --ignore-token`  
#### Clear a token
Tokens can be cleared from the CLI by running `allero config clear token`
| ensure-sca-scanner | Make sure every repository has at least one pipeline with sca scanner | Keep production secured
| ensure-terraform-scanner | Make sure every repository has at least one pipeline with terraform scanner  | Keep production secured

### üìù Adding your own rules
Rules can be defined using the [Json Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format. Json Schema rules should be based on our data schema. An example of our data schema structure can be found [here](https://github.com/allero-io/allero/tree/main/examples/rules/data-schema-example.json).
1. Create a new json file and define your rule. Example rules can be found [here](https://github.com/allero-io/allero/tree/main/examples/rules).
Make sure to update the rule description and failureMessage.
2. Copy-paste the rule-files to "~/.allero/rules/github/" and "~/.allero/rules/gitlab/".
3. Run `allero validate`
